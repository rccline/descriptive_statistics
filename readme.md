This repository is dedicated to demonstrating tools for creating descriptive statistics to render data summaries, frequency tables, etc.  


1. `tabbycat` is a small library of functions for tabulating and summarising categorical variables. Most of the functions are designed to work with dataframes, and use the tidyverse idiom of taking the dataframe as the first argument so they work within pipelines. Equivalent functions that operate directly on vectors are also provided where it makes sense. Folder `tabbycat` includes:  

* counting functions  
* jaccard similarity test  

2. docs_descriptive folder:   
* Frequency tabless from `summarytools package`;  
* pastecs package;` and `  
* skimr package` are described in docs_descriptive folder.  
* Cumulative frequency distribution examples
